# ScalableNFTSaleContract
This is a functioning and scalable NFT token contract. It comes with whitelist and public sale features. 

I have commented on essentially every line of code so that you can understand how it works.

If you would like to use ERC721A, here is my repository implementing that into a contract with the same features as this one. https://github.com/Shiva-Tzu/NFT_Sale-ERC721A
