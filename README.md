# ScalableNFTSaleContract
This is a functioning and scalable NFT token contract. It comes with whitelist and public sale features. 

I have commented on essentially every line of code so that you can understand how it works.

I have also made a version of this contract that implements ERC721A which is helpful for saving gas.
